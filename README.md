## Rules
* Develop your code on a branch
* Pull changes from main and update your local branch to avoid merge conflicts (do this every time someone merges code to main)
  * git checkout main
  * git pull
  * git checkout yourbranchname
  * git merge origin main
* When code is ready, create a pull request and have at least one person code review it before merging to main
